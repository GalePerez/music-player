                        There I was again tonight <br>
                        Forcing laughter, faking smiles <br>
                        Same old tired, lonely place <br>
                        Walls of insincerity, shifting eyes and vacancy <br>
                        Vanished when I saw your face <br>
                        All I can say is, it was enchanting to meet you <br>

                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Your eyes whispered, "Have we met?" <br>
                        'Cross the room your silhouette <br>
                        Starts to make its way to me <br>
                        The playful conversation starts <br>
                        Counter all your quick remarks <br>
                        Like passing notes in secrecy <br>

                        <br>
                        <br>
                        And it was enchanting to meet you <br>
                        All I can say is, I was enchanted to meet you <br>

                        This night is sparkling, don't you let it go <br>
                        I'm wonderstruck, blushing all the way home <br>
                        I'll spend forever wondering if you knew <br>
                        I was enchanted to meet you <br>

                        <br>
                        <br>
                        The lingering question kept me up <br>
                        2 AM, who do you love?  <br>
                        I wonder 'til I'm wide awake <br>
                        And now I'm pacing back and forth <br>
                        Wishing you were at my door <br>
                        I'd open up and you would say, "Hey" <br>
                        
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        It was enchanting to meet you <br>
                        All I know is, I was enchanted to meet you<br>

                        That this night is flawless, don't you let it go <br>
                        I'm wonderstruck, dancing around all alone <br>

                        This is me praying that <br>
                        This was the very first page <br>
                        Not where the story line ends <br>
                        My thoughts will echo your name, until I see you again <br>
                        These are the words I held back, as I was leaving too soon <br>
                        I was enchanted to meet you <br> 
                        Please don't be in love with someone else <br>
